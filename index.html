   <h2> What is CSS?</h2>
<ol>
    <li>CSS stands for cascading style sheets.</li> <br>
    <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper or in other media.</li><br>
    <li><span class="li3a">CSS is not necessary</span> <div class="li3b">css saves a lot of work.</div> <div class="li3c">It can control 
        layout of multiple pages all at once.</div></li> <br>
    <li><span class="li4" >External stylesheet are stored in css files.</span></li>
</ol>

<h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in three ways:</h3>
<ul class="ul1">
    <li style="color: brown;"> Inline-By using style attribute inside html elements.</li>
    <li class="ul2">Internal- By using a style elemwnt in the head section.</li>
    <li class="ul3">External- By using a link element to link to an external css file.</li>
    <li class="ul3">The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external css files. However, <span class="li3b"> in
        this tutorial we will use inline and  Internal styles,</span> Because it is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it 
        for yourself.</span> </li>
    </ul>

<p>When comapring CSS class vs Id, the difference is that the css class applies the style to multiple elements. ID on the other hand,
    applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special url to link directly to an element and it is
    used by javascript.
</p>

<p>
    In css selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style
    or set of styles can be applied to the element.
</p>
    
<p>
    There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and id. Both are used to target an element to 
    which style should be applied.
